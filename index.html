          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
          a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
          within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
          and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
          basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="what_is_html?" class="main-section">
        <header>What is HTML?</header>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
          hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
          bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
          content:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      </section>

      <section id="anatomy_of_an_html_element" class="main-section">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
          alt="Paragraph element including opening tag, content reading 'my cat is very grumpy', and a closing tag"
        />
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
            element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle
            brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
            effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening
            tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element
            name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
            paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard
            beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element,
            which in this case, is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and
            the content together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
          alt="Paragraph opening tag with a class attribute highlighted: class=editor-note"
        />
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't
          want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute
          name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute
          allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be
          used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value)
          with style information and other things. Some attributes have no
          value, such as <em>required</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
            if the element already has one or more attributes).
          </li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>
            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="nesting_elements" class="main-section">
        <header>Nesting elements</header>
        <p>
          You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
          nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
          wrap the word "very" in a
          <span class="mono">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which means that the
          word is to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
        <code
          >&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
          grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly
          nested. In the example above, we opened the
          <span class="mono">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then the
          <span class="mono">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element; therefore, we have
          to close the
          <span class="mono">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
          element first, then the <span class="mono">&lt;p&gt;</span> element.
          The following is incorrect:
        </p>
        <code
          >&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very
          grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly
          inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then
          your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were
          trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="void_elements" class="main-section">
        <header>Void elements</header>
        <p>
          Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the
          <span class="mono">&lt;img&gt;</span> element that we already have in
          our HTML page:
        </p>
        <code
          >&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
          <span class="mono">&lt;/img&gt;</span> tag and no inner content. This
          is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its
          purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="anatomy_of_an_html_document" class="main-section">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML document</header>
        <p>
          That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't
          handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are
          combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put
          into our <span class="mono">index.html</span> example (which we first
          met in the Dealing with files article):
        </p>
        <code>
          <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;</code>
          <code>&emsp;&lt;head&gt;</code>
          <code>&emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</code>
          <code
            >&emsp;&emsp;&lt;meta name="viewport"
            content="width=device-width"/&gt;</code
          >
          <code>&emsp;&emsp;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;</code>
          <code>&emsp;&lt;/head&gt;</code>
          <code>&emsp;&lt;body&gt;</code>
          <code
            >&emsp;&emsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test
            image"/&gt;</code
          >
          <code>&emsp;&lt;/body&gt;</code>
          <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
        </code>
        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> &mdash; doctype. It
            is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
            (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of
            rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML,
            which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
            However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just
            needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you
            need to know for now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span> &mdash; the
            <span class="mono">&lt;html&gt;</span> element. This element wraps
            all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the
            root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the
            primary language of the document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span> &mdash; the
            <span class="mono">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This element acts as
            a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page
            that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This
            includes things like keywords and a page description that you want
            to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set
            declarations, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span> &mdash; This
            element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8
            which includes most characters from the vast majority of written
            languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you
            might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help
            avoid some problems later on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono"
              >&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</span
            >
            &mdash; This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width
            of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider
            than the viewport and then shrinking them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span> &mdash; the
            <span class="mono">&lt;title&gt;</span> element. This sets the title
            of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the
            page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
            bookmark/favorite it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="mono">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span> &mdash; the
            <span class="mono">&lt;body&gt;</span> element. This contains all
            the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your
            page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio
            tracks, or whatever else.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="images" class="main-section">
        <header>Images</header>
        <p>
          Let's turn our attention to the
          <span class="mono">&lt;img&gt;</span> element again:
        </p>
        <code
          >&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it
          appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains
          the path to our image file.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt
          attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the
          image, possibly because of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual
            impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the
            alt text to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For
              example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src
              attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page,
              you should see something like this in place of the image:
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png"
              alt="The words: my test image"
            />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you
          write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good
          idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of
          "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our
          Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the
          Earth."

            Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your
            content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book
            has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document
            can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels,
            <span class="mono">&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</span>, although you'll
            commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
          </p>
          <code>
            <code>&lt;!-- 4 heading levels: --&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;</code>

        <section id="paragraphs" class="sub-section">
          <header>Paragraphs</header>
          <p>
            As explained above, <span class="mono">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements are
            for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when
            marking up regular text content:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt; </code>
        </section>

        <section id="lists" class="sub-section">
          <header>Lists</header>
          <p>
            A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements
            for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.
            The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of
              the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are
              wrapped in a <span class="mono">&lt;ul&gt;</span> element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of
              the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an
              <span class="mono">&lt;ol&gt;</span> element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Each item inside the lists is put inside an
            <span class="mono">&lt;li&gt;</span> (list item) element.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following
            paragraph fragment into a list
          </p>

          Links are very important &mdash; they are what makes the web a web! To
          add a link, we need to use a simple element &mdash;
          <span class="mono">&lt;a&gt;</span> &mdash; "a" being the short form
          for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow
          these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Wrap the text in an <span class="mono">&lt;a&gt;</span> element,
              as shown below:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Give the <span class="mono">&lt;a&gt;</span> element an href
              attribute, as shown below:
            </p>
            <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you
              want the link to:
            </p>
            <code
              >&lt;a
              href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;<br />
              &emsp;Mozilla Manifesto<br />
              &lt;/a&gt;
            </code>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You might get unexpected results if you omit the
          <span class="mono">https://</span> or
          <span class="mono">http://</span>
          part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After
          making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you
          wanted it to.
